Sentinel AI is your personal financial assistant, powered by IBM watsonx.ai, monitoring all your recurring transactions and automatically flags anything suspicious - like subscriptions you haven't used in months that are still charging you, sudden price increases you might not have noticed, or unusual rapid charges that don't fit your normal spending patterns. It proactively alerts you when something's off, so you can act fast. Instead of digging through bank statements yourself, you can simply ask Sentinel questions in plain English like "Why was this subscription flagged?" or "What did I spend on streaming last month?" and it'll give you a quick, straight answer using your actual transaction data. It turns managing your finances from tedious to effortless.
